# About Mel

## The Story

Mel was born out of necessity a few years ago when I was working with our Head of Communications, Mel, who needed to manage our static website. At the time, we were using Mercurial for version control, and the typical Git workflow was completely overwhelming for someone who just wanted to make simple content updates.

Mel needed to:
- Update blog posts
- Fix typos
- Add new pages
- Make small content changes

But the traditional developer workflow was a barrier:
- Creating branches
- Staging changes
- Committing with proper messages
- Pushing to remote
- Creating pull requests
- Dealing with merge conflicts

So I created a simple set of shortcuts that abstracted away all the complexity. Instead of learning Git commands, Mel could just run:

```bash
mel start    # Start working on something
# edit files...
mel sync     # Save and update with latest changes
mel publish  # Ship it
```

## Fast Forward to Today

Now I'm working with Product Managers who are learning to "vibe code" (as they call it). They're facing the exact same problems Mel faced years ago:

- They want to contribute to the codebase
- They need to make small changes and fixes
- The traditional developer workflow is intimidating
- They want to feel productive, not overwhelmed

## What Mel Is

Mel is for **any non-engineers** who still want to participate in a codebase in an organized and productive way. It's designed to be:

- **Simple**: Just a few commands to remember
- **Safe**: Built-in safeguards and helpful prompts
- **Organized**: Maintains proper Git workflow under the hood
- **Friendly**: Clear, non-technical language

## Who It's For

- **Content creators** who need to update websites
- **Product Managers** learning to contribute to codebases
- **Designers** making small UI tweaks
- **Anyone** who wants to participate in development without becoming a full-time engineer

## Bonus: Engineers Love It Too

Turns out, Mel isn't just for non-engineers. Regular engineers find it pretty nice too. Sometimes you just want to make a quick fix without thinking about branch names, commit messages, or the full Git workflow. Mel handles all the boring parts so you can focus on the actual work.

## The Philosophy

Codebases should be accessible to everyone who needs to contribute to them. You shouldn't need a computer science degree to fix a typo or add a new page. Mel bridges that gap by providing a friendly interface to the powerful tools that developers use every day.

The goal is simple: **Make contributing to codebases as easy as possible for everyone involved.**
